## Introduction

The Helsinki Region is experiencing rapid urbanization and population growth, leading to increased demand for housing. Accurate estimations of housing demand are essential for city planning, infrastructure development, and ensuring the availability of affordable housing for residents.

This project utilizes data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to estimate the future housing demand in the Helsinki Region. It takes into account various factors, such as population growth, economic indicators, and housing trends, to provide a comprehensive outlook on housing requirements.

## Data

We have collected and curated a diverse set of data sources to facilitate our housing demand estimation. These sources include:

- **Population Data:** Historical and projected population data for the Helsinki Region.
- **Economic Indicators:** Data on economic growth, employment rates, and income levels.
- **Housing Market Trends:** Information on housing prices, rental rates, and vacancy rates.
- **Urban Development Plans:** Insights into urban planning initiatives, infrastructure projects, and zoning regulations.
- **Environmental Factors:** Data on environmental sustainability and urban development.

The data used in this project is available in the `data` directory.

## Methodology

Our methodology for estimating housing demand involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring data patterns, correlations, and identifying relevant features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning models for prediction.
5. **Training and Validation:** Training models on historical data and validating their performance.
6. **Forecasting:** Using trained models to estimate housing demand for future years.
7. **Visualization:** Creating informative visualizations to present the results.
